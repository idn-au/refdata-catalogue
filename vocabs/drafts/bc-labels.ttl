The BC Labels define community expectations about appropriate use of biocultural collections and data. The BC Labels focus on accurate provenance, transparency and integrity in research engagements with Indigenous communities. The BC Labels ensure Indigenous people are represented in the metadata and create opportunities for future researchers to connect and support appropriate benefit sharing."@en ;
