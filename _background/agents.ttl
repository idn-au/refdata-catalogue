We use data modelling, data governance and data systems implementation expertise all based on Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph principles to ensure data is in the richest, most open and most extensible form it can be.

We use knowledge graphs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications.""" ;
